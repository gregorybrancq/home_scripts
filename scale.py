"""scale.py: Unminimizes and re-minimizes windows for Compiz's Scale plugin

More specifically:

- Unminimize all minimized viewport windows 
- Launch the Scale plugin of the Compiz window manager
- Re-minimize previously minimized windows (other than any newly activated
    window and windows closed through Scale)

In this script, you may customize the 'pluginDelay' variable. This variable
    refers to the duration between when Scale activates and when you may
    select a window using Scale. In rare instances, windows may spontaneously
    become active after they have been unminimized and after Scale has started,
    but before you have selected a window in Scale. A change in window status
    will trigger the reminimization process. By setting a short delay after
    Scale begins, these rare active window changes will be caught and ignored.
    Each such active window change will reset the time. Typically, it can be a
    small number (a fraction of a second) and is needed, if at all, only when
    the system is working under heavy load.
    
Scale can show the windows in the current viewport or all viewports. To have
    Scale show windows from the current viewport (the default), the command
    near the end of this script that begins 'org/freedesktop/compiz...',
    should read as follows:
    
        '/org/freedesktop/compiz/scale/allscreens/initiate_key'
        
To have Scale show windows from all viewports, change the command as follows:
    
        '/org/freedesktop/compiz/scale/allscreens/initiate_all_key'
        
Regardless of which approach you use, only the windows in the current viewport
    are (un)minimized. To (un)minimize windows from all viewports would be a
    dizzying experience due to the rapid viewport changing it would
    require.
